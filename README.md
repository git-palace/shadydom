# ShadyDOM

ShadyDOM provides a shim for ShadowDOM V1. It is less correct but less intrusive
and faster than the ShadowDOM Polyfill.

##Usage

Usage of the shim is transparent when `attachShadow` is unavailable. Elements are
patched as needed to report ShadowDOM correct dom information. Only dom tree
accessors and mutation api is maintained. Some dom api
(for example MutationObservers) is not shimmed.

To force ShadyDOM to be used even when native ShadowDOM is available, set
the `shadydom="true"` attribute on the `webcomponents-lite.js` script or
the url query string `?shadydom=true`.

##Example

```html
<div id="host"></div>
<script>
  host.attachShadow({mode: 'open');
  host.shadowRoot.appendChild(document.createElement('a'));
</script>

```

##Limitations

ShadyDOM distribution is asynchronous for performance reasons. This means that
the composed dom will be available 1 microtask after the dom mutation occurs.
For testing, `ShadyDOM.flush` may be called to force syncronous composition.

ShadowDOM compatible styling is *not* provided with the ShadyDOM shim. To
shim ShadowDOM styling, use the ShadyStyling shim.
